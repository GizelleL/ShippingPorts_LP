# ShippingPorts_LP
Objective: Using linear programming, we will attempt optimize the load of vessels across ports. 

Balance Load Across Ports: If the dataset includes multiple ports within the same country or region, an objective could be to balance the load of incoming and outgoing vessels among these ports to avoid overloading a single port.

Also, by understanding the vessel count among ports, resource allocation can be optimized; For example, allocate resources (like workforce, cranes, etc.) optimally based on the expected arrivals and departures. This would involve ensuring that resources are available when needed for loading and unloading vessels, but are not sitting idle when not needed.
